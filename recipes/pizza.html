        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>Pizza Sauce</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>6 oz tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 tsp dried oregano, crushed</li>
            <li>1 tsp dried basil, crushed</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>

            <li>1/2 tsp sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Pizza Crust</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 envelopes yeast</li>
            <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 1/3 cups warm water</li>
            <li>1/3 cup oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Toppings</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 package pepperoni</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>For sauce: Combine all sauce ingredients with 1/2 cup water in a medium bowl; set aside for flavors to develop while making crust. Freeze remaining paste.</li>
            <li>For crusts: Combine 2 cups of flour with the dry yeast, sugar and salt. Add the water and oil and mix until well blended (about 1 minute). Gradually add enough remaining flour slowly, until a soft, sticky dough ball is formed.</li>
            <li>Knead for about 4 minutes, on a floured surface, until dough is smooth and elastic. Add more flour, if needed. (If using RapidRiseÂ® Yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)</li>
            <li>Divide dough in half. Pat each half (with floured hands) into a 12-inch greased pizza pan OR roll dough to fit pans.</li>
            <li>For pizzas: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Top crusts with sauce, pepperoni and cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake for 18 to 20 minutes until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly. For best results, rotate pizza pans between top and bottom oven racks halfway through baking.</li>
        </ol>
