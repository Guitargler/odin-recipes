        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Lasagna with sausage, mushrooms, and lots of cheese is fast and easy on the stove top--and there's no compromise on flavor.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 pound hot Italian sausage</li>
            <li>1 medium red bell pepper, diced</li>
            <li>1 jar RAGU Traditional Sauce</li>
            <li>1 package no-boil lasagna sheets, broken into large pieces</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp crushed dried rosemary</li>
            <li>8 oz ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>8 oz mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
            <li>2 tbsp minced fresh parsley</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium high heat and add olive oil. Swirl to coat. Add the onion and saute until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the sausage, red pepper, and mushrooms; saute until meat is cooked through, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in the Ragu® Old World Style® Traditional sauce, broken lasagna noodles, water, and rosemary. Cover and turn heat down to medium-low.</li>
            <li>Cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is al dente. Remove the lid and add the ricotta, 2/3 of the cheese, and parsley; stir to combine. Top with remaining mozzarella and serve immediately.</li>
